| Over the last 20 years, several studies comparing recent survey data with historical data from the early 20th century documented an increase in species numbers on high mountain summits of the European Alps. This increase has more or less explicitly been attributed to an upward migration of plant species due to anthropogenic climate warming. However, a reconsideration of the historical and recent data has revealed that more than 90% of the recent species occurrences on mountain summits concern species that were already present at the same or even at higher altitudes within the study region at the time of the historical surveys. This finding suggests that suitable habitats already occurred on these summits under the mesoclimatic conditions prevailing at the beginning of the 20th century and that these habitats were, at least in part, occupied by these plant species. Consequently, the observed increase in species number during the last century does not require the additional temperature increase due to anthropogenic climate change. We therefore consider the phenomenon of increasing species number on high mountain summits to be primarily the result of a natural dispersal process that was triggered by the temperature increase at the end of the Little Ice Age and that is still in progress mostly due to the dispersal limitation of the species involved. Since both the natural dispersal process and a potential upward migration due to anthropogenic climate warming would take place at the same time, we suggest seeding and transplanting experiments in order to assess their respective roles in the increase in species number on mountain summits. © IAVS; Opulus Press.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Over the last 20 years, several studies comparing recent survey data with historical data from the early 20th century documented an increase in species numbers on high mountain summits of the European Alps.

Since both the natural dispersal process and a potential upward migration due to anthropogenic climate warming would take place at the same time, we suggest seeding and transplanting experiments in order to assess their respective roles in the increase in species number on mountain summits.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Plant functional type- and trait-based approaches to understanding vegetation dynamics are gradually gaining popularity. However, plant mycorrhizal traits are rarely considered in plant trait databases and are almost totally neglected in trait-based plant community studies, despite more than 90% of the land flora being mycorrhizal. In this paper I describe and define the mycorrhizal traits of plant species, notably mycorrhizal type,mycorrhizal status,mycorrhizal flexibility and mycorrhizal dependency, which potentially influence plant distribution and community structure. I propose ways of using these traits for large-scale synthetic studies for understanding the role of mycorrhizal symbiosis in vegetation dynamics. I suggest considering plant community mycorrhization - community means of mycorrhizal traits weighted by plant species abundances - and suggest an index ofmycorrhization to describe themycorrhizal trait composition of plant communities. © 2014 International Association for Vegetation Science.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                | Plant functional type- and trait-based approaches to understanding vegetation dynamics are gradually gaining popularity.

| Question: Does the role of dispersal and light limitation for community assembly change in temperate semi-natural dry grasslands (SNDGs) post-abandonment?. Location: Temperate calcareous semi-natural dry grasslands, western Estonia (58.642 N, 23.516 E). Methods: We compared taxonomic and functional community structure of semi-natural dry grasslands in Estonia at two time periods: first in 1975 when traditional grazing prevailed, and again in 2013 when management had ceased for at least 30 yr. In order to assess functional community structure, we used community-weighted mean trait values and mean pair-wise distance as metrics of functional diversity for traits related to plant dispersal and adaptations to reduced light availability. Successional shifts in functional community structure were examined using regression and multivariate analysis. Results: Changes in community assembly of SNDGs post-abandonment were largely driven by more closed vegetation structure and subsequently reduced light availability, as well as altered availability of dispersal vectors. Importance of long-distance dispersal via grazing animals decreased while importance of bird dispersal increased under abandonment. At the same time, the importance of competition for light increased under abandonment. Results indicate that typical SNDG species are especially susceptible to abandonment because they are light-demanding and depend on dispersal by wind or epizoochory (i.e. on the fur of animals), and their decline likely leads to reduced small-scale species richness. Conclusions: Vegetation changes in abandoned SNDGs show that regular management, by creating characteristic light and dispersal conditions, is highly important for maintaining both taxonomic and functional diversity. In particular, typical grassland species might be prone to local extinction as taller vegetation develops post-abandonment. The importance of dispersal processes for community assembly observed in grazed SNDGs thus highlights that successful grassland conservation should include maintenance of dispersal conditions. Grassland conservation should aim to preserve the whole ecosystem and account for the multiple ecosystem processes (e.g. light availability, dispersal), which simultaneously structure plant community composition. © 2016 International Association for Vegetation Science | Question: Does the role of dispersal and light limitation for community assembly change in temperate semi-natural dry grasslands (SNDGs) post-abandonment?.

| Questions: Do old-growth forests retain more evolutionary history and more reproductive trait diversity along the successional gradient? How similar are the phylogenetic branches and reproductive attributes at each phase? In which succession stages are distinct lineages of trees and shrubs present? Do distinct lineages have distinct traits? Is there a turnover of species, lineages and traits of trees and shrubs along the successional gradient?. Location: Atlantic Forest, Reserva Natural Guaricica (25°19′ S, 45°42′ W) and Reserva Natural das Águas (25°21′ S, 48°46′ W), Antonina, Paraná, southern Brazil. Methods: We assessed the variation of alpha and beta taxonomic, functional and phylogenetic diversities of tree and shrub communities along a successional gradient (phase 1, stand initiation phase, from 0 to 9 years old; phase 2, stem exclusion phase, 10–25 years old; and phase 3, understorey re-initiation phase, 25–200 years old). We also evaluated the occurrence of distinct lineages and traits related to seed dispersal and pollination. Results: In addition to the expected change in species composition, lineages and trait states and values were replaced along the chronosequence, with stronger variation for trees. Old-growth forests harbor distinct lineages and traits and a greater amount of evolutionary history and functional diversity of reproductive traits. We also found that distinct lineages were those that performed distinct functions. Conclusions: Our study showed that as the succession proceeds, turnover of lineages and traits occurred, with the understorey re-initiation stage harboring the largest taxonomic, phylogenetic and functional diversity. In addition, understories of the re-initiation stage are important for the occurrence of distinct lineages, such as magnoliids, and of distinct traits, such as large fruits and seeds, which highlights the importance of conservation of old-growth forests, and its preservation can prevent the loss of distinct evolutionary histories and functions. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Questions: Do old-growth forests retain more evolutionary history and more reproductive trait diversity along the successional gradient?

| Questions: Biosolids are a source of nutrient-rich organic material that can be used to improve degraded or disturbed soils. Research on vegetation responses to the land application of biosolids has increased in the past 20 years, but there is no consensus on how plant communities respond to biosolids applications. What factors influence productivity and vegetative cover following biosolids application for grassland reclamation? How does the addition of biosolids impact plant community responses?. Location: Global, but predominantly North America and Europe. Methods: To explore vegetative responses following biosolids application, we used a global systematic review and meta-analysis of 59 articles. Our meta-analysis used the log response ratio (LRR) as an effect size for productivity, total cover, species richness, diversity and exotic species abundance and explored covariates addressing various site characteristics and reclamation strategies. Results: We found that across sites, the land application of biosolids significantly increased productivity and cover but had no significant overall effect on species richness, Shannon diversity or exotic species abundance on degraded lands. These increases in the LRR for productivity and vegetative cover were lower on sites that experienced a fire prior to biosolids application. Climatic variables like mean annual temperature were shown to alter the response of vegetative cover, where warmer sites tended to have more positive responses to biosolids. Seeding was found to increase plant cover but decrease species richness early in the reclamation process. Conclusions: This area of research is growing; most of the publications we used come from the last 20 years and were mostly conducted in North America and Europe. While we can build on the present literature, there is clearly room for more research to ensure the process of reclaiming degraded ecosystems using biosolids results in desired plant communities, e.g. high native species diversity. Future research should consistently report biosolids chemical characteristics as well as application and processing methodologies. © 2021 International Association for Vegetation Science                                                                                                                                                                 | Questions: Biosolids are a source of nutrient-rich organic material that can be used to improve degraded or disturbed soils.

| Aims: To link the Braun-Blanquet units of the EuroVegChecklist (EVC) with the upper levels of the International Vegetation Classification (IVC), and to propose a division level classification for Europe. Study area: Europe. Methods: We established a tabular linkage between EVC classes and IVC formations and identified mismatches between these two levels. We then proposed IVC division level units to organize EVC classes. Results: We organized the EVC classes into 21 formations and 30 divisions. We flagged classes that did not fit comfortably within an existing formation, either because its content corresponded to more than one formation or because it did not fit any formation description. In a few cases, we split EVC classes because they seemed too heterogenous to be assigned to a single formation. Conclusions: The IVC approach adds a set of physiognomic and ecological criteria that effectively organizes the EVC classes, which are already being increasingly informed by physiognomy. Therefore, the formation concepts are relatively natural extensions of concepts already embedded in the classes. However, physiognomic placement of Braun-Blanquet classes can be difficult when the sampling of the vegetation is at finer grain than usual in the respective formation (tall-scrub, annual pioneer communities). Some EVC classes seem too heterogenous to fit into the IVC formation system. Delimitation of these classes has often been a matter of debate for many decades, and the IVC perspective might help to solve these intricate issues. In other cases, mismatches between phytosociological classes and IVC formations might better be solved by emending the current formation concepts.

| Aims: The USNVC is the standard for vegetation classification in the US and is part of the broader IVC. Recent work on the USNVC in Alaska established macrogroups, groups and alliances. Here we incorporate tussock tundra and low and tall willow (Salix) groups and alliances for northwestern Arctic Alaska into the IVC and USNVC classification. Study Area: The study area encompasses the Seward Peninsula, the western Brooks Range, and the northwestern foothills and Arctic coastal plain of Alaska. Methods: We used data from 2,087 relevé plots collected between 1992 and 2019 from northwestern Arctic Alaska to prepare a draft association classification using cluster analysis, ordination, and sorted tables. The draft classification was subject to peer review and subsequently refined. We fit the tussock tundra and low and tall willow associations into the USNVC using NMDS and GAMs to evaluate the patterns of environmental gradients against the ordination axis scores. Results: We identified eight tussock tundra and 37 low and tall willow associations. The associations fit in two classes, two subclasses, two formations, two divisions, three macrogroups, four groups, and 13 alliances. A description of the alliances, and a field guide to the northwestern Arctic Alaska tussock tundra and low and tall willow associations, including a dichotomous key and descriptions, is provided. Conclusions: Many of the tussock tundra and low and tall willow associations fit seamlessly within the USNVC, while some alliances had yet to be defined, and we have proposed new alliances here. In still other cases, we proposed a new group and recommend broadening the concept of an existing group using a data-driven approach. Since not all available data from Arctic Alaska were used in this study, we suggest continuing with a more comprehensive analysis to fulfill the gap at the alliance and association levels for Arctic Alaska.

| In order to stabilize the defining concepts of the higher rank syntaxonomic units such as class or order, the criteria of floristic content and unity of origin are enunciated. This is done with the aim of preventing the fragmentation of the large classes and the subsequent typological inflation. For orders, the criterion of specific floristic content is discussed, with orders that have been described to encompass seral secondary forests or the separation of forest vegetation from that which is dominated by shrubs rejected, due to their weak floristic characterization. These criteria have been applied to two forest vegetation classes: the European temperate (Querco-Fagetea) and the Mediterranean (Quercetea ilicis). For the first, it is argued in favor of maintaining a single class for all temperate deciduous forests in Europe instead of dividing them into four. Within this single class five orders are distinguished: Fagetalia, Quercetalia roboris, Quercetalia pubescenti-petraeae, Alno-Fraxinetalia and Populetalia albae, rejecting the orders that have been proposed for secondary forests because they have few characteristic taxa. For the sclerophyllous and macchia forests of Mediterranean Europe, the Quercetea ilicis class can be split into two or three geographical orders, rejecting the Pistacio-Rhamnetalia alaterni as a shrubby physiognomic unit.

| Aims: To use unsupervised techniques to produce a hierarchical classification of montane mires of the study region. Study area: New England Tablelands Bioregion (NETB) of eastern Australia. Methods: A dataset of 280 vascular floristic survey plots placed across the variation in montane mires of the NETB was collated. Vegetation types were identified with the aid of a clustering method based on group averaging and tested using similarity profile analysis (SIMPROF) and through ordinations using Bray-Curtis similarity and non-metric multidimensional scaling (NMDS). A hierarchical schema was developed based on EcoVeg hierarchy and was circumscribed using positive and negative diagnostic taxa via similarity percentage analysis (SIMPER) and importance based on summed cover scores and frequency. Results: We defined one macrogroup to include all montane mire vegetation of the NETB and within these two groups and twelve alliances. Conclusions: Our study re-enforced the separation of bogs from other montane mire systems and confirmed the separation of fens and wet meadows, a distinction that previously had not been independently tested. Based on our results many existing montane mire communities of the NETB have been ill-defined at multiple hierarchical levels, leading to confusion in threat status and mapping. Additionally, nearly half of the alliances we recognise were found to have no correlates within current classification systems, which necessarily has implications for the effectiveness of current conservation planning.

| The environmental factors correlating with community structure of vegetation on talus slopes of the 785 km long Niagara Escarpment, southern Ontario, Canada, were studied using canonical correspondence and regression analysis. The bryophytes and higher vascular plants were analysed separately to see if their responses were similar or different. Both vascular plants and bryophytes responded similarly to the environmental variables that were measured. For both vegetation components, location from north to south explained most of the variance. When species richness was plotted against location for the complete vegetation and for the two components separately, the results showed that vascular plant species richness decreased with increasing latitude, while bryophyte richness increased. The magnitude of both of these trends was slight but consistent with the hypothesis that available environmental energy governs a significant amount of the variance in species richness. Since separate components of the talus vegetation were shown to respond differently to the same environmental variable, groups of taxa should not be excluded from community level studies without a consideration of the possible consequences of this bias. 1993 IAVS ‐ the International Association of Vegetation Science                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | The environmental factors correlating with community structure of vegetation on talus slopes of the 785 km long Niagara Escarpment, southern Ontario, Canada, were studied using canonical correspondence and regression analysis.

| Abstract. Human impact influences patterns of plant distribution and dominates disturbance dynamics in the agricultural landscape of Haut‐Saint‐Laurent, Québec. We investigated the influence of such impact on the dynamics of Thuja occidentalis in the hardwood forest of southern Québec. A bimodal species of either dry or wet habitats, T. occidentalis has successfully invaded mesic sites of the study area where, although generally considered a poor competitor, it persists as dense populations that seem to resist invasion by more tolerant species. As Acer saccharum is expected to be a dominant latesuccessional species under mesic conditions, we first evaluated the relative importance of abiotic and historical factors in the distribution of 34 T. occidentalis stands and 21 A. saccharum stands. We then classified 55 stands that include T. occidentalis and investigated the dynamic relationships between the species and its associates in 13 mixed mesic sites. Canonical correspondence analysis (CCA) of T. occidentalis and A. saccharum stands suggested that land use and drainage are the most important variables correlated with plant community composition. A partial CCA with drainage as the constraining variable showed that T. occidentalis stands were significantly associated to present or past use as pasture. Correspondence analysis of 55 stands where T. occidentalis is present produced a clear segregation between nearly monospecific stands and mixed communities, but the chosen environmental variables were not significant in explaining the vegetation gradient at this scale. In all mixed stands, Thuja occidentalis was most often associated with Ulmus americana, Acer rubrum, Betula populifolia, Fraxinus americana, A. saccharum, and Tsuga canadensis. Finally, size‐class ordination of 13 mixed mesic stands did not show convergence toward A. saccharum. Our results suggest that grazing has played a significant part in the appearance of T. occidentalis stands on mesic sites, whereas competition processes and landscape patterns possibly contribute to the maintenance of relatively persistent T. occidentalis stands in the landscape. 1995 IAVS ‐ the International Association of Vegetation Science | Abstract.

| Abstract. Simulated vegetation data of known structure and varying complexity were analyzed with Correspondence Analysis (CA), Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), and a polythetic divisive method of classification as incorporated in the computer program TWINSPAN. The CA and DCA axes were statistically compared with the original gradients. In the case of TWINSPAN, the results were visually evaluated. The analyses showed that both CA and DCA will recover the first vegetation gradient in an acceptable manner only if the variation in the vegetation due to second or higher order gradients is small. Second gradients were never recovered in a meaningful manner.

Simulated vegetation data of known structure and varying complexity were analyzed with Correspondence Analysis (CA), Detrended Correspondence Analysis (DCA), and a polythetic divisive method of classification as incorporated in the computer program TWINSPAN. The CA and DCA axes were statistically compared with the original gradients. In the case of TWINSPAN, the results were visually evaluated. The analyses showed that both CA and DCA will recover the first vegetation gradient in an acceptable manner only if the variation in the vegetation due to second or higher order gradients is small. Second gradients were never recovered in a meaningful manner. The sample points along these axes were so far displaced from their original positions along the gradients that the axes could not be used to represent the gradients. In particular, when the two gradients have the same length, CA and DCA gave very poor results for both the first and the second axes. This is thought to be one of the main reasons why TWINSPAN does not perform well, especially after the first division.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Abstract. Primary succession on Mount St. Helens, Washington State, USA, was studied using long‐term observational and experimental methods. Distance from potential colonists is a major factor that impedes early primary succession. Sites near undisturbed vegetation remain low in plant cover, but species richness is comparable to intact vegetation. Sites over 500 m from sources of potential colonists have as many species, but mean species richness is much lower than in undisturbed plots. Cover is barely measurable after 11 growing seasons. Highly vagrant species of Asteraceae and Epilobium dominate isolated sites. Sites contiguous to undisturbed communities are dominated by large‐seeded species. For a new surface to offer suitable conditions to invading plants, weathering, erosion and nutrient inputs must first occur. The earliest colonists are usually confined to specific microsites that offer some physical protection and enhanced resources. Primary succession on Mount St. Helens has been very slow because most habitats are isolated and physically stressful. Well‐dispersed species lack the ability to establish until physical processes ameliorate the site. Species capable of establishment lack suitable dispersal abilities. Subsequently, facilitation may occur, for example through symbiotic nitrogen fixation, but these effects are thus far of only local importance. Lupinus lepidus usually facilitates colonization of other species only after it dies, leaving behind enriched soil lacking any competitors. Experiments and fine‐scale observations suggest that successional sequences on Mount St. Helens are not mechanistically necessary. Rather, they result from local circumstances, landscape effects and chance. 1993 IAVS ‐ the International Association of Vegetation Science                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Abstract.

| Abstract. The Northern Iberian Peninsula is dominated by various types of vegetation from deciduous oak and ash to evergreen oak woodlands. A recent vegetation map of Spain portrays vegetation series which are characterized in terms of their phytogeographic region or bioclimatic (altitudinal) belt. The aim of this paper is to determine whether the areas comprised by both phytogeographic regions (Eurosiberian and Mediterranean) in the study area, as established from the phytogeographic characterization of the vegetation, can be discriminated by climatic variables using multivariate methods, and to compare these with other conventional approaches. In addition, bioclimatic (altitudinal) belts and the main vegetation types were tested for discrimination by climatic variables. Conventional climatic criteria as well as discriminant and principal component analysis were applied to climatic data from 205 meteorological stations for which vegetation information had been taken from the vegetation map. Conventional criteria are good predictors of the phytogeographic division (Mediterranean and Eurosiberian regions) in the study area. Results were improved by multiple discriminant analysis based on climatic data of the dry period of the year (June to September). Both regions in the study area can be predicted with over 95 % accuracy. Using the same multivariate procedure and temperature data the bioclimatic (altitudinal) belts of the study area can be predicted with over 90 % accuracy. The main vegetation groups of the study area can also be predicted with over 80 % accuracy. Ordination analysis supported the results of the discriminant analysis. Empirical models have been generated to predict the phytogeographic‐ and belt character of any station in the area. The significance of the various periods of the year for discriminating regions and belts is evaluated. The responsiveness to climatic events during the year may be region specific. This study confirms the strong relationship between climate and vegetation in the Northern Iberian Peninsula, particularly regarding the Eurosiberian‐Mediterranean boundary. 1990 IAVS ‐ the International Association of Vegetation Science                  | Abstract.

    ## [1] "Abstract.  The launching of international phytosociological projects requires a re‐evaluation of vegetation units (syntaxa) of different phytosociological schools and their integration into one global classification system. Despite many difficulties, this possibility is offered by the floristic‐phytosociological system ‐ a hierarchical system of syntaxa defined by floristic‐socio‐logical criteria. Associations (and lower syntaxa) of the Zürich‐Montpellier School as well as associations (later called sociations) of the Uppsala School are defined by means of the floristic composition of plant communities and fit this postulate; their syntaxonomic identity can be checked by tabular comparison of vegetation relevés. Not only the presence of diagnostic species but also the specific combination of sociological groups of species, dominance of species or even the absence of certain species or species groups can be used as syntaxonomic criteria. The syntaxonomic identification of an association of the Uppsala School with one of the Zürich‐Montpellier School means uniting syntaxa of the same rank in the sense of the Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature. If a sociation is found to fit the criteria of an association delimited by the Zürich‐Montpellier methods, the rank of an association can be attributed to this sociation and its name can thus be validated in the sense of the Code."
    ## [2] "Abstract. Seed germination of three perennial grasses, Agrostis curtisii, Avenula marginata and Pseudarrhenatherum longifolium was studied in relation to the position (basal, intermediate, apical) in the panicle and two factors typically associated with fire, high temperatures and ash. Two similar germination responses were observed in A. curtisii and A. marginata: (1) germination rates were lower for seeds from higher positions in the inflorescence; and (2) watering with a plant‐ash solution improved the ability of apical seeds to germinate, but had the opposite effect on basal seeds. In A. curtisii, the latter response was also dependent on whether or not the seed was exposed to high temperatures. In P. longifoliium the exposure to high temperatures and the position of the seeds in the inflorescence influenced the effect of ash. This could be due to the different degrees of development of the seeds."                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
    ## [3] "Abstract.  : The exotic tree Ailanthus altissima is usually confined to open sites. As an exception, Ailanthus established in a densely closed forest in West Virginia, which was analyzed with the aim to elucidate possible pathways of persistence in forest succession of this light‐demanding pioneer species. Demographic analysis revealed a seedling mortality of 100 %. Instead, the understory is populated by clonal ramets, ranging from one to more than 19 yr of age, with a mean of 5 yr. Growth averages only 0.11 m/yr, and height is correlated with age. This clonal growth contrasts with the performance of Ailanthus on open sites.

    ## [5] "Abstract.  Interpretation of aerial photographs (1962–1965) revealed vegetation asymmetry on opposite valley slopes in the semi‐arid to semi‐humid zones of the island of Oahu. Field studies after 5 and 10 yr showed that this asymmetry is a transitional feature during recovery from disturbance (fire). The types of asymmetry ranged from difference in vigour of shrub canopies to total difference in floristic composition. Slopes exposed to the trade winds are typically characterized by grassy vegetation and landslides, whereas on the protected part of the upper west‐facing slope immediately behind a ridge, vigorous shrubs and trees grow without any mechanical damage or deformation of crowns. This part of the slope is richer in species, including rare ones, than other parts. It is also characterized by the invasion of grasses from more exposed sites and the elongation of shrub canopies above the crest line. Different levels of exposure to exceptionally strong trade winds and salt spray at different parts of slopes seem to allow different speeds of recovery and thus contrasting vegetation structure and species composition. The existence of many shrub seedlings on the exposed upper slope suggests that succession is taking place and the vegetation asymmetry seems at least structurally to be a transitional feature."

    ## [1] " The launching of international phytosociological projects requires a re‐evaluation of vegetation units (syntaxa) of different phytosociological schools and their integration into one global classification system. Despite many difficulties, this possibility is offered by the floristic‐phytosociological system ‐ a hierarchical system of syntaxa defined by floristic‐socio‐logical criteria. Associations (and lower syntaxa) of the Zürich‐Montpellier School as well as associations (later called sociations) of the Uppsala School are defined by means of the floristic composition of plant communities and fit this postulate; their syntaxonomic identity can be checked by tabular comparison of vegetation relevés. Not only the presence of diagnostic species but also the specific combination of sociological groups of species, dominance of species or even the absence of certain species or species groups can be used as syntaxonomic criteria. The syntaxonomic identification of an association of the Uppsala School with one of the Zürich‐Montpellier School means uniting syntaxa of the same rank in the sense of the Code of Phytosociological Nomenclature. If a sociation is found to fit the criteria of an association delimited by the Zürich‐Montpellier methods, the rank of an association can be attributed to this sociation and its name can thus be validated in the sense of the Code."
    ## [2] "Seed germination of three perennial grasses, Agrostis curtisii, Avenula marginata and Pseudarrhenatherum longifolium was studied in relation to the position (basal, intermediate, apical) in the panicle and two factors typically associated with fire, high temperatures and ash. Two similar germination responses were observed in A. curtisii and A. marginata: (1) germination rates were lower for seeds from higher positions in the inflorescence; and (2) watering with a plant‐ash solution improved the ability of apical seeds to germinate, but had the opposite effect on basal seeds. In A. curtisii, the latter response was also dependent on whether or not the seed was exposed to high temperatures. In P. longifoliium the exposure to high temperatures and the position of the seeds in the inflorescence influenced the effect of ash. This could be due to the different degrees of development of the seeds."

| 161  | Vegetation Classification and Survey | Vegetation structure and composition at different elevational intervals in the arid Tankwa Karoo National Park, South Africa                                         | 2023 | Study area: The study was conducted in the Tankwa Karoo National Park, one of the driest areas in South Africa. Historic overgrazing has resulted in the poor and often degraded state of vegetation in large parts of the Tanqua Karoo region. Aim: This study assessed the spatial variation of vegetation structure and composition in the three main vegetation types namely: Tanqua Karoo (TK), Tanqua Wash Riviere (TWR) and Tanqua Escarpment Shrubland (TES), along an elevational gradient. Method: Using the point intercept survey method, vegetation cover, plant height, species diversity, life forms, proportions of perennials and annuals were examined in 43 sites, widely distributed in these vegetation types. Results: There were 150 vascular plant species belonging to 83 genera and 29 families recorded across all sites. The most diverse vegetation type was TES with 96 species belonging to 61 genera and 26 families. The vegetation structure was comprised mainly of shrubs and dwarf shrubs with a high proportion of leaf and stem succulent species. The mean perennial vegetation cover throughout the study area was 28 and annuals covered 22%, but this cover varied significantly between the vegetation types. The most dominant life forms were chamaephytes, which comprised 64% of all species, with cryptophytes (18%), therophytes (16%) and nanophanerophytes (2%) less abundant. Surveyed sites in the TES showed a clear association with each other but there was an overlap in the species composition and environmental conditions between some TWR and TK sites. This study highlighted the important role of elevation and topography as drivers of vegetation characteristics. Conclusion: The findings from this study can be used as a vegetation baseline to identify and prioritise degraded areas for active restoration in order to limit further degradation. Considering climate change, elevational studies may provide additional insight into species dynamics across landscapes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 971  | Applied Vegetation Science           | Initial understory vegetation responses following different forest management intensities in Illyrian beech forests                                                  | 2019 | Background and questions: How forest vegetation responds to disturbance continues to be a focal point, especially in the context of biodiversity conservation. To investigate the short-term effects of forest management on understory vegetation, we asked: (a) Are there any plant indicator species associated with different felling intensities? (b) What are the differences in abundance of plant functional types along the disturbance gradient? (c) How do typical forest species respond to silvicultural treatments?. Location: Dinaric Mountains, Slovenia. Methods: At each of three study sites in Illyrian beech forests, nine plots (4,000 m 2 ) were established, comprising a total of 27 plots. Three different felling intensities were implemented at each site, with one third of the plots assigned to each treatment: control, 50% of the growing stock removed and 100% of the growing stock removed. In the centre of each plot, a vegetation survey of vascular plants was done before (in 2012) and two years after (in 2014) felling in a circular sampling area of 400 m 2 . We employed indicator species analysis, and species were grouped into functional types with respect to their traits. Results: Understory species composition differed significantly between treatments. Forty-seven species (out of 251) were significantly associated with the 100% felling intensity. This relatively high number of indicators was due to the post-disturbance colonization of early-successional, non-forest species, coupled with the expansion of pre-treatment resident species. Only one species was a strong indicator for the 50% felled plots, while three species showed a preference for the unfelled plots. Graminoids, tall perennial forbs, annual/biennial forbs and legumes exhibited the most prominent increase in cover at the 50% and 100% felling intensity. Ferns showed non-significant changes, whereas woody plants exhibited a decrease in the most intensive treatment. In general, most of the typical forest species responded with increased frequency and/or abundance after felling. Conclusions: The post-treatment taxonomic and functional composition of plant communities exhibited the largest changes in the most intensively felled stands. Overall, in the short term, ecological conditions in canopy gaps were not modified to an extent that would be detrimental to the persistence of typical forest species. © 2018 International Association for Vegetation Science |
| 1226 | Journal of Vegetation Science        | The role of plant functional traits in shrub distribution around alpine frost hollows                                                                                | 2017 | Introduction/Aims: Functional traits aid understanding of species distribution and community composition along environmental gradients. However, studies that detail trait measurements along fine-scale environmental gradients are lacking for many vulnerable ecosystems. In this paper, we quantify how plant traits might explain the composition of shrubs in one such vulnerable system – frost hollows. Location: Bogong High Plains, Victoria, Australia. Methods: We measured species composition and a suite of traits (shrub height, stem specific density, leaf area and SLA, xylem vessel area and density, and leaf bud traits) for shrub species in three, 10 m × 10 m quadrats located across transition from hilltops down into frost hollows. We used ordinal regression to model vegetation transitions by relating the changes in shrub species occurrence along frost hollow gradients to each trait, and across multiple traits. We also assessed intraspecific trait variations along gradients. Results: Several traits explained the position of species along a gradient of cold air accumulation (slopes leading into frost hollows). The most important traits were maximum shrub height, leaf area and xylem traits, which were clearly related to species location on the slopes in single trait models. More complex relationships were revealed with multi-trait models, which indicated that shorter species, those with smaller leaves and larger buds for their leaf size, and those with lower vessel density were more likely to be found toward the bottom of the slope. Within species, taller individuals and those with denser stems were also more common up-slope. Conclusion: Our results suggest a shift in ecological strategies in frost hollows: the advantages of being taller and having large leaves may be diminished in these stressful environments. Shrubs that are shorter and have smaller leaves may also be better at avoiding the risk of frost damage. Our study shows how the fine-scale turnover of shrub species composition around frost hollows relates to plant functional traits, and captures the allocation trade-offs between coping with environmental stress and being competitive within these plant communities.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 1459 | Journal of Vegetation Science        | Mixed-severity natural disturbance regime dominates in an old-growth Norway spruce forest of northwest Russia                                                        | 2016 | Quesions: What were the long-term disturbance rates (including variability) and agents in pristine Norway spruce-dominated (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) forests? Have soil moisture conditions influenced disturbance rates across this boreal spruce-dominated forest? Were the temporal recruitment patterns of canopy dominants associated with past disturbance periods? Location: Interfluvial region of Northern Dvina and Pinega rivers, Arkhangelsk, northwest Russia. Methods: We linked dendrochronological data with tree spatial data (n trees = 1659) to reconstruct the temporal and spatial patterns of canopy gaps in a 1.8-ha area from 1831-2008, and to develop a growth-release chronology from 1775-2008. Results: No evidence of stand-replacing disturbances was found within selected forest stands over the studied period. Forest dynamics were driven by small- to moderate-scale canopy disturbances, which maintained a multi-cohort age structure. Disturbance peaks were observed in the 1820s, 1920s, 1970s and 2000s, with decadal rates reaching 32% of the stand area disturbed. Conclusions: The overall mean decadal rate was 8.3% canopy area disturbed, which suggests a canopy turnover time of 122 yr, with a 95% confidence envelop of 91-186 yr. Bark beetle outbreaks (possibly exacerbated by droughts) and wind-storms emerged as the principal disturbance agents. Recruitment of both Norway spruce and downy birch was associated with periods of increased canopy disturbance. Moisture conditions (moist vs mesic stands) were not significantly related to long-term disturbance rates. The studied spruce-dominated boreal forests of this region apparently exhibited long-term forest continuity under this mixed-severity disturbance regime. These disturbances caused considerable structural alterations to forest canopies, but apparently did not result in a pronounced successional shifts in tree species composition, rather occasional minor enrichments of birch in these heavily spruce-dominated stands.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Location: Flood-meadows at the northern Upper Rhine, Germany. Methods: From 1998 to 2004 annually, and again in 2008, species composition and above-ground biomass were studied in 46 permanent plots located along a flooding gradient ranging from frequently flooded Magnocaricion to rarely flooded Arrhenaterion meadows. The plots were situated in the functional floodplain (natural) and in the fossil floodplain on the land side of high winter levees (anthropogenic altered). Temporal variation of the functional structure was analysed based on community-weighted mean traits. Results: Productivity and functional structure varied markedly over the study period and between the functional and fossil floodplain. During the study period two contrasting extreme events occurred: a summer flood in 1999 and a drought period after 2003. After the flood in 1999, species composition and functional structure of the studied flood-meadows shifted towards the species composition of wetter sites. Flooding reduced species richness in the functional floodplain, but not in the fossil floodplain. Conclusions: Flood-meadows in the Upper Rhine fully recover from extreme disturbance events within a time frame of less than 10 yr. Environmental fluctuations and disturbances, enabling the co-existence of species with contrasting ecological requirements are a key factor for the preservation of plant biodiversity in flood-meadows.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 1650 | Journal of Vegetation Science        | Disturbance legacies and paludification mediate the ecological impact of an intensifying wildfire regime in the clay belt boreal forest of eastern North America     | 2015 | High moisture levels and low occurrences of wildfires have contributed during recent millennia to the accumulation of thick layers of organic soil and to a succession into open black spruce (Picea mariana)-Sphagnum-dominated forests in the Clay Belt boreal landscapes of eastern North America. In these forests, the anticipated increase in drought frequency with climate change could lead to a shift in forest structure and composition via increased fire disturbance. Here, we quantify the expected changes in fire behaviour, biomass burning and vegetation composition in the Clay Belt forest of North America that could arise under climate change over the next century. Location: A managed forest unit in the Clay Belt boreal forest of eastern North America. Methods: The impact of a changing climate from 1971 to 2100 on fire regime characteristics (i.e. rate of spread, fuel consumption, fire intensity, type of fire and depth of burn) and vegetation dynamics (mortality and recruitment) was investigated using the Canadian Fire Effects Model (CanFIRE). Vegetation dynamics were governed by the fire danger and behaviour that affect tree mortality and post-fire recruitment of species, and by long-term successional pathways that are driven by post-fire recruitment and forest age. An ensemble of two climate models forced by three scenarios of greenhouse gas emissions was used to drive CanFIRE simulations. Results: Results from multiple scenarios suggested that fire danger will increase significantly during the 21st century in the Clay Belt forest. The burn rate was projected to change from 4.2% decade-1 during 1971-2000 to 18.6% decade-1 during 2071-2100. Stand mortality, fire intensity and areas affected by crown fires were also projected to increase. A shift in forest composition did not occur over the simulation period across most of our fire regime scenarios. Dominance of open black spruce-Sphagnum forests was projected to remain in future landscapes. Conclusions: Moist and cool conditions in these forests prevent high depth of burn and contribute to the ecological resistance of these forests to increasing fire danger.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 2653 | Applied Vegetation Science           | The success of succession: A symposium commemorating the 50th anniversary of the buell-small succession study                                                        | 2009 | Motivation: The Buell-Small Succession Study (BSS) is the longest running study of post agricultural succession in North America. To honor this program, a symposium at the Ecological Society of America meetings was organized to explore the state of succession theory and its contribution to the field of ecology and its application to restoration. The BSS was originally motivated by two controversies in the literature during the 1950’s. The first was between a community versus and individual basis of secondary succession. The second was the validity of the Initial Floristic Composition hypothesis. Location: Hutcheson Memorial Forest, Somerset, New Jersey, USA Methods: Vegetation composition and cover has been continuously quantified in permanent plots established in 10 old fields. Continued Research Motivation: The rich data set has documented population and community dynamics and the spatio-temporal controls and historical contingencies that influence those dynamics. The regulation of community dynamics continues to be a line of inquiry as does the application of results to restoration and understanding the dynamics of non-native species. Conclusions: Long term vegetation studies are uncommon in ecology yet they are uniquely valuable for understanding system dynamics - particularly if the studies capture periodic events or system shifts such as droughts and invasions by non-native species. Resilient long term studies, of which the BSS is an example, maintain methods and data structure while allowing motivating questions to evolve along side advancements in the theoretical and conceptual realms of the field. Succession continues to serve as a basic tenet of ecology which is demonstrated by the papers making up this special issue.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

What are the effects of topsoil, subsoil and fertilization on natural revegetation? Location: Akershus county, SE Norway (10°25’ E, 59° 44’ N). Methods: We used a recently constructed road through a boreal coniferous forest for a three year (2000-2002), fully replicated revegetation experiment (six replications). Treatments were soil type (two levels; one topsoil and one subsoil type) and fertilization (two levels; NPK and unfertilized control). Ordination methods, constrained ordination methods as well as univariate statistical methods, such as Wilcoxon’s signed-rank test and correlation analysis, were used to assess the relative importance and significance of treatments on the plant species composition. Results: There was no fertilization effect on species composition. The species composition on both soil types was stabilised by the second year. The species dominating the topsoil were more in accordance with the indigenous vegetation than was the case on the subsoil. The significant difference in species composition among blocks, persisting for the entire study period, indicated that local factors are important determinants of the outcome of revegetation. Conclusion: Unfertilized topsoil provides a revegetation result in better accordance with the indigenous vegetation than does subsoil.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

Location: Boreal Sweden. Methods: We linked data from three 50 m \* 50 m permanent plots established in 1986 with dendrochronology data to evaluate tree growth and mortality over an 18-year period and to describe a several-hundred-year disturbance history for this forest type. Results: Averaged over all diameters, P. abies trees had an annual mortality rate of 0.60%; however, diameter had a striking effect on both growth and mortality, with trees of intermediate diameters (ca. 20-30 cm) showing faster growth and lower mortality. Their increased vigor gave rise to a diameter distribution resembling the ‘rotated sigmoid’ (not reverse-J) proposed for such conditions, and it led to a deficit of snags of intermediate diameters. Slow-growing trees had an increased likelihood of dying. Although recruitment occurred in most decades over the past 400 years, two prominent recruitment peaks occurred (mid 1700s and 1800s), neither of which appeared to cause a shift in tree species composition. The lack of fire evidence suggests that fire was not responsible for these recruitment peaks. Conclusions: Taken together, these results depict a rather impassive system, where canopy trees die slowly over decades. Field observations suggest that fungal infections, mediated by wind, account for much of the mortality during these periods of relative quiescence. However, these periods are at times punctuated by moderate-severity disturbances that foster abundant recruitment.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

Location: Mar Lodge Estate, Scottish Highlands, United Kingdom. Methods: 26 fire sites of different ages and 11 long-term unburnt stands were surveyed to create a chronosequence of changing lichen diversity following burning. Data were analysed graphically, with a GLM and using a CCA. Results: Though the immediate effect of fire was to significantly reduce lichen diversity, it generally recovered within 20 years. There was a significant difference in the population dynamics between wet and dry moorland areas with terricolous lichens in the former site being replaced by pleurocarpous mosses. Older stands, unburnt for 25 years or more, generally had lower diversity than stands 10 to 15 years old. Changes in lichen diversity and community composition can be attributed to the development of Calluna stand structure following burning. Conclusions: Fire can be seen to play an important role in maintaining the diversity of lichens in heathland areas by providing a variety of stand-structures and ages across the landscape that favours the development of greater beta-diversity.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Methods: Sampling was stratified by stand structure. Epiphyte biomass was estimated based on lichen litter for three functional groups: cyanolichens, forage lichens, and matrix lichens. Regression models for estimating lichen biomass (log10 kg.ha-1) were developed based on three pools of predictors, each pool demanding different levels of effort to obtain the data. First, we created models from topographic predictors that are easily extracted from GIS data. We then developed models based on both topographic and stand-structure variables. Finally, we developed models using topography, stand structure, and lichen community data. Results/Conclusions: Lichen biomass changed with elevation, cyanolichen biomass highest at low elevations (470-950 m) and forage lichen biomass highest at higher elevations (950-1470 m). Lichen biomass was lowest in even-aged young stands and highest in mature stands with remnant trees and in old-growth. Stands with remnant trees had more lichen biomass than even-aged stands. Models with the greatest explanatory power were: cyanolichen biomass predicted as a function of elevation, stand age index, the sum of Lobaria oregana and L. pulmonaria abundance, and cyanolichen species richness (R2 = 0.85); forage lichen biomass predicted as a function of stand age index and, Alectoria sarmentosa abundance (R2= 0.55); and matrix lichen biomass predicted as a function of stand age index and matrix lichen abundance (R2 = 0.58). These models are useful tools for understanding and predicting the distribution of epiphytic macrolichen biomass at a landscape scale.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 3136 | Journal of Vegetation Science        | Effects of fire severity and initial tree composition on understorey vegetation dynamics in a boreal landscape inferred from chronosequence and paleoecological data | 2005 | Question and Location: How does soil burn severity and early post-fire tree composition affect long-term understorey vegetation dynamics in the coniferous forests of eastern Canada? Method: Vegetation dynamics were assessed using paleoecological methods and a chronosequence analysis of extant stands. The relation between environmental factors and succession was evaluated using ordination techniques on the chronosequence data. Understorey succession was studied by regression analysis on the chronosequence data and through within-site Markovian transition probabilities between successive 1-cm layers of plant macroremains from soil organic matter profiles. Results: Initial tree composition (Picea mariana and Pinus banksiana) had little effect on understorey composition. Soil burn severity (measured as the thickness of the residual forest floor humus) significantly affected temporal changes in understorey species. Following fires of high severity, stands underwent a gradual paludification with a net increase in Sphagnum and ericaceous shrubs (Ledum groenlandicum), and a decrease in feathermosses. Paludification was accelerated after low severity fires, which led to the dominance of Sphagnum less than 200 years after fire, and of L. groenlandicum shortly after fire. In situ paleo-ecological work confirmed results obtained with the chronosequence analysis. Conclusions: One vegetation gradient related to time after disturbance is insufficient to account for the full complexity of long-term changes in understorey composition following fire. Current forestry practices that protect the forest floor humus may induce a premature paludification.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
